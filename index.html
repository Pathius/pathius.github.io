          I have advanced knowledge about
          <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I know to how to write solid, modular
          code and produce great user friendly applications. In my daily work I
          use <strong>BEM</strong> and <strong>SCSS</strong>. I'm always trying
          to aim at accessibility of my websites and be sure that everyone will
          be happy about them!
          <br />
          <br />
          My main JavaScript framework is <strong>Vue.js</strong>. I love its
          simplicity and modularity potential. State in my apps is managed by
          <strong>VueX</strong> and I'm currently learning how to develop SSR
          websites using the <strong>Nuxt.js</strong>. In my commercial
          experience I've used <strong>VueStorefront</strong> and
          <strong>Magento</strong> to develop ecommerce websites.
          <br />
          <br />
          In my daily work routine I use such tools as
          <strong>Prettier</strong> and <strong>ESLint</strong>. All of my
          personal projects are on my
          <a href="https://github.com/Pathius" target="_blank"
            ><strong>GitHub</strong></a
          >, but I have also experience working with <strong>GitLab</strong>.
